Thoughts on learning styles:
	Personally, I have a lot of mixed feelings on learning styles. I know this is more than the question was asking, however, in total transparency I feel that really applying learning styles to any sort of education system requires an entire restructure of the American education system. I think I’m a little cynical about any test-based personality types in the face of academia because my personal experience with learning hasn't always been great. I have Dyslexia, and I’ve always found the concept of learning styles frustrating. I think that the idea of learning styles implies there is a universal utilitarian educational goal that should be achieved, which to me seems a little silly. The concept puts the onus on the student- implying that if you are not able to learn a concept, it's because you are teaching yourself wrong, and you must alter the class for your own learning style. I just think it's very judgemental and shifts the responsibility of learning from the system onto the individual. If students are not learning, I think it might be due to misunderstanding of individuals' learning styles, however more likely than not it's due to a system of education which is not inclusive to those learning styles. In summary,  I think knowing is helpful, but it's just not enough.
