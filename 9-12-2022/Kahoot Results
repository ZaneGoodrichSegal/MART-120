I'm not sure if I'll ever turn in this repository, I hope I do , becuase I did it all, I just had the wrong due date.
Anyway, today I geared up to do the kahoot quiz (the last thing on my list to do), and saw it was closed.
Which I thought was weird, then I realized the whole unit was closed
Then I realized my final mistake
thought it was due on Wenesday

If I do ever turn in this repository, I would love to do the quiz
I'm sure I'd ace it
I did all the work
I just didnt turn it in
