    <h3>Birthday Story </h3>
<br>
    One of these years Id like to 
    <br>
    Forget my own birthday
    <br>
    And be hastily reminded
    <br>
        By an email
        <br>
        <br>
            From a loved one
            <br>
                Or a robot
                <br>
                Sent by a corporation
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
    
    Id like to run to the store
    <br>
    During my lunch break
    <br>
    Desperate to find something to
     <br>
    Act like I didn't slip between
    <br>
    My own fingers
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Amongst other things
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Sweating. 
    <br>
    Like a father from a comic strip-
    <br>
    Forgetting his anniversary, or valentines day,
    <br>
    And no gifts on Hanukkah, 
    <br>
    nor any chocolate eggs for easter
    <br>
    Quickly dispersed in the backyard.

    <br>
    The thought is postponed in lue of work or life.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    
    Id like to wake up completely unaware,
    <br>
    And sit on my front porch drinking coffee. 
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Baking in the comfort of summer heat
    <br>
    Something you I remember-
    <br>
    Distant memory
    <br>
    Decimated by time 
    <br>
    Sobbing and Soaking
    <br>
    The first time I have ever been held
    <br>
    Hot breath over my body
    <br>
    Sweating on my first august morning
    <br>
    
    <br>
